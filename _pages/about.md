â€‹I am an incoming assistant professor in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of Guelph (starting in January 2026). I am currently an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Chemical Engineering at McGill University. My research focuses on optimizing green infrastructure for the removal of emerging environmental contaminants. I hold an HBSc (Physical and Environmental Geography) and a PhD in Forestry from the University of Toronto, where I specialized in water quality, plant science, and soil science under joint supervision with the Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering. My doctoral research focused on the design optimization and intelligent monitoring of green infrastructure to improve water treatment efficiency, vegetation performance, and long-term ecosystem sustainability. With an interdisciplinary background, she bridges theoretical and applied research by integrating empirical experimentation, hydrological modeling, geospatial analysis, and data science to advance the performance and resilience of nature-based solutions under a changing climate.

Teaching
======
In addition to research,  I am passionate about teaching. I have independently taught CIV220 (Urban Engineering Ecology), a core undergraduate course in the Department of Civil & Mineral Engineering at the University of Toronto (143 students). I also served as the primary instructor for the field course CIV201 (Introduction to Civil Engineering) for two consecutive years, teaching over 180 students in total. Throughout my graduate study, I held more than ten teaching assistantships at both the undergraduate and graduate levels across Forestry, Civil Engineering, and Landscape Architecture. 

Fun
======
Beyond academia, I am a table tennis player (National Grade 2), and I love skiing, hiking, badminton, scuba diving (PADI licensed), and travel.
